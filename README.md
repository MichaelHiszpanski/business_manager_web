## About the Website

This website is part of the **Business Manager** project, which serves as the web counterpart to the main mobile application built in **Flutter**. The primary purpose of the website is to provide documentation, resources, and support for users of the Business Manager app, along with extending its functionality to a web platform.

### **Authentication**
Authentication for the website is handled using **Firebase**, ensuring secure user sign-in and session management. Firebase's robust infrastructure makes it ideal for scalable and reliable authentication solutions.

### **Next.js and TypeScript**
The website is built using **Next.js**, a powerful React framework that provides server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO. The project is developed using **TypeScript**, which ensures strong typing and improves code reliability, making development faster and easier to maintain.
