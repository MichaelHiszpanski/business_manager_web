# Web Development Guide

Web development involves the creation and maintenance of websites. It encompasses various aspects, including web design, web programming, and database management.

## Getting Started

1. **Learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:** These are the building blocks of web development.
2. **Understand the basics of web design:** Learn about responsive design, UX/UI principles, and accessibility.
3. **Learn a web development framework:** Enhance your skills with frameworks like React.js and Next.js.

> :bulb: **Tip:** Continuously improve your skills and keep up with the latest web technologies.

## My Skills

### React.js

React.js is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and makes managing state and rendering efficient and straightforward.

#### Key Features

- **Component-Based Architecture:** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Virtual DOM:** Efficient updates by only re-rendering parts of the UI that have changed.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow:** Ensures predictable state management and easy debugging.

### Next.js

Next.js is a popular React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, making it ideal for building highly optimized and SEO-friendly web applications.

#### Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Enhances performance by pre-rendering pages on the server.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG):** Generates static HTML at build time, offering better performance and SEO.
- **API Routes:** Allows you to create API endpoints within the Next.js application.
- **Built-In CSS Support:** Seamlessly integrates CSS and Sass, providing flexibility in styling components.

#### Example Code

```jsx
import React from "react";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, React!</h1>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
