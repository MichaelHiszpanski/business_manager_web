### SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and SSG (Static Site Generation)

#### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

**Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** is a technique where the HTML of a web page is generated on the server for each request and sent to the client. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Improved SEO:** Fully rendered HTML makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index content.
- **Faster Initial Load:** Users see a fully rendered page quickly, reducing the time to first meaningful paint.
- **Better Performance for Dynamic Content:** Ideal for pages with frequently changing content.

**Use Cases for SSR:**

- E-commerce sites with frequently updated content.
- News websites needing up-to-date articles.
- Applications prioritizing SEO.

#### SSG (Static Site Generation)

**Static Site Generation (SSG)** is a technique where the HTML of a web page is generated at build time and served as static files. This method provides several advantages:

- **High Performance:** Pre-rendered static files ensure fast server response times and quick page loads.
- **Scalability:** Easy to handle large amounts of traffic with static files distributed via a CDN.
- **Security:** Reduced attack surface with no server-side processing on each request.

**Use Cases for SSG:**

- Blogs and documentation sites with infrequent content changes.
- Marketing websites requiring fast load times and excellent SEO.
- Portfolio sites or static content-heavy pages.

Both SSR and SSG are supported by frameworks like Next.js, allowing developers to choose the best approach based on their web application's specific needs.
